			<p>Olympic athletes are some of the most talented indivduals in the athletic world, competing at the highest level of competition in their respective sport. When thinking about the capacity of these athletes, you may begin to wonder; at what point do their bodies reach peak performance? </p>

They're made of sweat, determination, and a hard-to-find alloy called guts." and with that being said, looking at the age of athletes is important in determining just how much sweat and determination is required for each athlete to individually succeed relative to their age.</p>

			<h3>Age and Professional Analysis</h3>

			<p>Athletic performance, especially at the highest level, is the furthest thing from subjective in the eyes of data. Multiple factors go into determining how athletes are able to compete in the Olympic Games as young as sixteen-year-old Track and Field athlete Quincy Wilson and even as old as fifty-nine-year-old Equestrian Laura Kraut. </p>

			<p> One way of determining  a male or female athletes peak age of performance is a method known as "Survival Analysis". This methodology is defined as "a collection of statistical procedures for data analysis where the outcome variable of interest is time until an event occurs." by the <!DOCTYPE html>

			<p> "Our question was phrased as: The time until an athlete would hit or reach their peak." said Matthew Chow, alongside David Awosaga, two data-analysts who have studied this notion, specifically in the realm of Track and Field. </p>

		
<p> "We actually found there was no difference between the peak ages of men and women," Awosaga said. Along with this finding, the two discovered this peak age to be <b>twenty-seven</b>. </p>

<h3>Factors in an Athlete's Peak Age</h3>

<p> Awosaga and Chow described some of the main factors influencing changes in the average age of athletes. The first of those being training age- how long an athlete has been competing at an elite level. </p>
<p> For this factor, Matthew said that they looked at the first time an athlete appeared in the dataset [how young they were] and at what level were they competing at during this time. Chow added that training age is "the biggest predictor of when you would hit your peak age." </p>
<p> Event category is also a distinction the two analysts define as a factor. "Long-distance runners usually peak later than sprint runners." Chow said, "Presumably, it's the things that are more burst-intensive would have a younger peak age than things that are endurance-related."</p>
<p>Nationality was another factor the analysts added, in terms of what certain countries invest into their elite athlete programs and what resources are available to these athletes in each of the countires they perform on behalf of.

				<h2>Other Sources Say...</h2>

			<p>Another way to test athletes in real-time is via athletic performance examinations. Garry Palmer, a sports physiologist and sports performance center owner, executes analyses such as these on athletes. </p>
			<p>"One of the key reasons behind this is an athlete's aerobic capacity, which is the maximum amount of oxygen that an individual can use each minute during strenuous exercise." Palmer said in an article on <!DOCTYPE html>

		Oxygen plays a significant role in the aerobic capacity of athletes. This VO2 max is used to measure efficiency of valves and muscles that push blood back into the heart; an increase in age has the potential of decreasing this maximum heartrate and therefore, decreasing performance. </p>
			<p>In the same article, researchers were able to define aerobic events as "over 5 minutes" in duration. "The average age for peak anaerobic [oxgyenless] performance was around 23, compared with 26 for aerobic events." researchers in the study discovered. </p>

			<h3>Comparing and Conluding</h3>
			<p>Looking back on Awosaga and Chow's findings as data analysts while looking at those of sports physiologists, you begin to see how their results go hand in hand. From the data side of things, Awosaga and Chow found a striking difference between sprint and distance events. In terms of the physiologists, these events are known as anaerobic (sprint) and aerobic (distance). An important addition to support the findings of the data analysts can be located in the results of the science behind the VO2 max research provided by the physiologists.</p>

			<p> The overarching picture of the research defines peak age of an athlete as twenty-seven without limiting the age an athlete can begin performing or continue perfomring until. However, there is an age at which these elite athletes will perform at their best and being aware of this age is important in determining when they will medal at the next Olympics. </p>
